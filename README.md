# Topicmodels
TOPIC MODELING
PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 4

In this programming project we implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and inspect 
its performance both in an unsupervised manner and when used as a preprocessing step for supervised learning.
In the case of LDA, the output represents a sample of the (hidden) topic variables for each word.
